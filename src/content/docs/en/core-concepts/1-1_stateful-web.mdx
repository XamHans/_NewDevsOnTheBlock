### There was a game and a very sad boy

There was a boy called Vitalik. He liked to play World of Warcraft. His avatar was a warlock. He really enjoyed playing but then
something happend. Blizzard nerfed a spell for warlocks, called "Siphon Life". Vitalik didnt understand why they did that and cried himself to sleep.
This moment was an eye opener for him. He realized that a centralize service like Blizzard (the company behind World of Warcraft) can change the rules of the game at any time.
And this not only applies to games, but to all centralized services like social media, banking, etc. They define the rules and he had to play by them.

He quit playing World of Warcraft and started to learn about Bitcoin. He was fascinated by the idea that he even dropped out of university to focus on crypto full time.
He went around the world, explored many crypto projects and noticed one thing. They were to specific like Bitcoin for example which is only a digital currency.
He wanted to create platform like a operating system. A platform that is not controlled by a single entity. A platform that is open and permissionless.
What he created changed the world forever. He created Ethereum.
