<h2>What is NewDevsOnTheBlock?</h2>
NewDevsOnTheBlock has one mission. To connect you with web3 developers in order to make you more
successful. Also, it's a central place in a decentralized world, where you can easily access
resources like knowledge, hackathons, tool-kits, and more.

## Story behind NewDevsOnTheBlock

Johannes was a curious developer who wanted to get into web3, but he didn't know how to start.
His work was very time-consuming and all the new web3 concepts and terms were overwhelming.
He almost wanted to give up, but then he got a message from someone he did not know on LinkedIn.
This person was also a developer named Collins. He reached out to him said: I saw that you are also interested in web3, maybe we can team up and help each other?
They started to learn together and after a while, they were able to take part in the Chainlink Hackathon.
Even though they did not win, they learned a lot and became friends.

This dear reader is something I wish for you too. This is why I have created NewDevsOnTheBlock. So that you can find people who have the same goals, to support you and to achieve goals together.
